## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram:
-capturing in real-time with stories
-messaging and sharing content
-fun filters

BeReal:
-capturing content during a random time, seems more authentic
-love the ability to react 

Snapchat:
-capturing photos with fun filters in real time or not
-fun filters

All these social media platforms have a lot in common, they capture content and share it with their friends. It shows that there needs to be tremendous engagement for apps to succeed. I use all of those platforms since they allow me to connect with people, react, etc. even if I haven't seen them in a long time. An idea I have is a to-do list app, where you can capture a photo while your doing a task and share that you've completed a task with your close friends and family. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges I encountered while bringing the app had to do with what was happening when I reopened the app in a new repository, the app would stop working. Another challenge I encountered was connecting the UI logic to the button, for some reason the assistant wouldn't open the viewer controller file alongside the main file, so I had to watch more videos. I rebuilt this app about 5 times due to the repository issue, and that made me understand this project a lot more.
